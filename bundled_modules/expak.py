"""Extract and process resources from Quake-style pak files.

The :func:`extract_resources` and :func:`process_resources` functions of this
module enable programmatic extraction and (optional) processing of resources
from one or more pak files.

The :func:`resource_names` function retrieves a set of all the resource names
in one or more pak files.

All of these functions have a ``sources`` parameter which can accept either a
string specifying the filepath of a single pak file to process, or an iterable
container of strings specifying multiple pak files to process.

Resource selection (using a set of names or a name map) and processing (with a
user-provided function hook) is described in more detail in the documentation
for each function.

The return status of :func:`extract_resources`/:func:`process_resources` is an
indicator of whether exceptions were encountered while reading the pak file or
processing resources. For the simple "extract everything" uses, this return
status maps directly to whether all of the intended resources were extracted.
For usage patterns that explicitly supply an input set or dict of resources
however, you should check that container after the invocation to see which
resources were not handled (if any).

Example of retrieving resource names from a pak file:

.. code-block:: python

    pak0_resource_set = expak.resource_names("pak0.pak")

Example of extracting all resources from multiple pak files:

.. code-block:: python

    expak.extract_resources(["pak0.pak", "pak1.pak"])

Example of extracting specified resources from multiple pak files:

.. code-block:: python

    sources = ["pak0.pak", "pak1.pak"]
    targets = set(["sound/misc/basekey.wav", "sound/misc/medkey.wav"])
    expak.extract_resources(sources, targets)

More complex example:

.. code-block:: python

    # Extract sound/misc/basekey.wav, convert it to OGG format, and save the
    # result as base_key.ogg. Similarly process sound/misc/medkey.wav to
    # create medieval_key.ogg. Look for those resources in pak0.pak and in
    # pak1.pak.
    def ogg_converter(orig_data, name):
        new_data = my_ogg_conversion_func_not_shown_here(orig_data)
        with open(name, 'wb') as outstream:
            outstream.write(new_data)
        return True
    sources = ["pak0.pak", "pak1.pak"]
    targets = {"sound/misc/basekey.wav" : "base_key.ogg",
               "sound/misc/medkey.wav"  : "medieval_key.ogg"}
    expak.process_resources(sources, ogg_converter, targets)
    # Notify if some of the desired files were not created.
    if targets:
        print("not found (or not successfully processed):")
        for p in targets:
            print("    {0}".format(p))

    The ``converter`` parameter accepts a function that will be used to process
    each selected resource that is found in a pak file. This converter function
    accepts the resource binary content and a name string as arguments. It
    returns a boolean success status, which indicates whether the resource was
    processed but does not affect the overall return value of process_resources.
    The converter function may also raise any exception to stop processing a
    given resource; this does not immediately interrupt the overall
    process_resources loop, but will cause process_resources to return False
    when it finishes.

    The :func:`nop_converter` function in this module is an example of a simple
    converter function that just writes out the resource content in its original
    form.

    The selected resources, and the name passed to the converter function for
    each, depend on the type and content of the ``targets`` argument:

    * None: Every resource in the pak file is selected. The name passed to the
      converter function is the resource name.

    * set: Resources are selected only if their name is in the set. The name
      passed to the converter function is the resource name.

    * dict: Resources are selected only if their name is a key in the dict. The
      name passed to the converter function is the result of looking up the
      resource name in the dict.

    If the ``targets`` argument is a set or dict, the element corresponding to
    each found and successfully processed resource is removed from it.

    This function will return True if each specified source is a pak file, is
    read without I/O errors, and is processed without converter exceptions.
    False otherwise.

    .. note::

         In the case where ``targets`` is not None, a True result does not
         indicate that all of the resources in ``targets`` were found and
         processed. And if False is returned, some processing may have been

    Examples of extracting specific resources from pak files:

    .. code-block:: none

        simple_expak pak1.pak sound/misc/basekey.wav

        simple_expak pak0.pak pak1.pak maps/e1m1.bsp maps/e2m1.bsp maps/e3m1.bsp

    Whenever a resource is extracted from a pak file, it will be created under
    a directory path relative to the current working directory, determined by
    the resource name as described for the :func:`expak.nop_converter` function.

    If any user-specified resources are not found, or are unable to be
    extracted, then :program:`simple_expak` will print a list of such resources
    once it is done.

    An I/O error during reading a pak file or writing an extracted resource will
    not prevent :program:`simple_expak` from continuing with other pak files or
    resources. Once :program:`simple_expak` is done processing as many
    paks/resources as possible, it will exit with a status of 0 if no such
    exceptions were encountered, or 1 otherwise.

    .. note::

         :program:`python -m expak` behaves identically to
         :program:`simple_expak`.
